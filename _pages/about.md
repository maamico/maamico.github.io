I am an assistant professor of statistics (Chaire de Professeur Junior - tenure track) at the University of Montpellier (France) since December 2024. I am affiliated with the Desbrest Institute of Epidemiology and Public Health, an INSERM – University of Montpellier Research Unit and the Medecine Faculty of Montpellier University.

I obtained a joint Ph.D in Statistics from Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (KU Leuven) and Université catholique de Louvain (UCLouvain) in Belgium, under the supervision of Prof. I. Van Keilegom (KU Leuven) and Prof. C. Legrand (UCLouvain).   
My thesis manuscript is available here.

Before joining the University of Montpellier, I worked as biostastistician at the Clinical Research Unit of Nestlé Research Center in Lausanne, Switzerland, from March 2019 to August 2021, and at the Clinical Research and Epidemiology Unit of Montpellier University Hospital from September 2022 to November 2024.
